# 16-bit-up-down-counter

## Description
This project implements a 16-Bit Up/Down Counter in VHDL. The counter can increment or decrement its value based on a control signal, providing a simple yet effective way to manage counting operations in digital systems.

## Files
- `counter_16bit.vhd`: Main VHDL implementation of the counter.
- `counter_tb.vhd`: Testbench for verifying the functionality of the counter.

## Usage
To simulate the design, load the VHDL files in your VHDL simulation tool (e.g., Vivado, Quartus) and run the testbench.
